                                We want to thank everyone who had an opportunity to join us and participate in the State of Black Tech Town Forum at General Assembly. For those of you who were unable to join definitely reach out to
those ToC members who were in the building! We are sure they will tell you about
the amazing range of conversations and topics that were covered when it comes
to our shared experience in this arena.&nbsp;
One of the most important points for us as organizers was to ensure that
this conversation was not just talk but also an opportunity where we can begin
to develop tangible solutions for our community that we can implement in the
context of this group.&nbsp; We
also were focused on not only providing a forum for you to speak, but also
ensuring that <b>you were heard</b>.

                                There were many problems, concerns, and potential solutions
that were discussed Thursday, ranging from workplace racism, gender inequality,
and the value of STEM or STEAM, yet some stood out as poignant issues or
actions that we feel also need to be tackled:

with each other we sometime we take each other for granted by </span><b>devaluing a person skills</b><span> in search for
a “hook up”.</span></li><li><b>There are many resources</b><span> in our community who
work in technology or provide access to technology education however it is </span><b>difficult to</b><span> </span><b>discover everything available</b><span> and to </span><b>determine their legitimacy.</b></li><li><span>We want to give our time
to volunteer, and we have done that, but we want to expand our </span><b>work beyond kids</b><span>, to also </span><b>include adults and seniors</b><span>. We also
want to know places that </span><b>have a need for
us.</b></li><li><span>There many of different
avenues that can be taken in technology, all of which can come with a variety
of experiences, but those who work in different areas </span><b>don’t really know about each other</b><span> or </span><b>how they can work together</b><span>. To the point where it can even become </span><b>divisive.</b></li></ul>

                            <p class="lead">A predominate action item that was proposed by several members and supported by many in the audience was a need for a list of resources that highlighted skills and offerings of individual ToC members or organizations associated with ToC.  We wanted to take that idea one step further and begin an initiative that will focus on not only addressing an immediate need for learning the strengths within our group but also serve as our platform for how we can grow and leverage our strength to tackle many of the larger issues we discussed in the future.</p>

                                For Individuals, becoming a ToC Connect Partner is a pledge to dedicate some of your time (such as through volunteering, mentoring, or presenting a workshop)
                                or giving towards an event (such as donating to a Code Your World class). Businesses or Community Organizations will have additional options such as
                                hosting or sponsoring events and presenting new volunteering/outreach opportunities. ToC will work to support our partners with dedicated events that support their growth initiatives.
                                In additon to marketing partners as trusted resources, events such as Partner Expos and Partner Education Meetups will help to demonstrate that we
                                have a vested interested in ensuring that our partners grow and are successful just as we look for ToC to do the same.

                            <p> All of our Connect Partners will be featured on the ToC Connect Platform, a publicly available and searchable site sponsored by ToC that will profile partnered individual, businesses, and organizations
                            detailing their skills, services, their service to ToC as well as their <b>ToC Impact</b>: a measure of how their contributions have impacted our community.

                            <p>At the end of the day these partnerships and this platform is driven by You, the Community, from the beginning to end. 
                            For ToC Members looking to become partners the first step is pledging service and completing one or more of the things you committed to do. 
                            We will look to the feedback we receive from the community as well as from our committee to ensure the partnership is the right fit. And there are no limits on the number of partners we have!
                            Our goal is to help foster future leaders in service to the community when it comes to technology; in our mind every ToC Member should become a Connect Partner.

                                    I'm giving her some career guidance when she needs it.&nbsp; I receive some
                                    inquiries concerning doing side work or for full time employment but I also get
                                    requests from ToC to volunteer more if I'm available.&nbsp; I definitely attend
                                    Connect partner events where I have access to my peers for support or maybe
                                    develop a new community initiative for ToC. The best partner event I've
                                    attended so far was ensuring I understood my worth and how I can brand and

                                I started with going to happy hour where I met a local startup founder, named Todd, who's a ToC Connect Partner.  
                                He encouraged me to attend a ToC "Startups from the Bottom" workshop that he was giving at Polygon and I immediately became inspired! I made sure to volunteer at whatever event or seminar he presented just so I can learn through osmosis. 
                                Finally when the Mentor Meetup arrived I made sure to sign up with Todd so I can get the encouragement to take the big leap of faith and go out on my own. Really great to have found ToC!"

                                        through a friend who is a member. He mentioned that there was an online
                                        resource called Connect where I can look for places that teach technology to
                                        kids.&nbsp; On Connect I found out about a
                                        local organization, who is a Connect Partner, that teaches robotics and was
                                        having a class sponsored by ToC. The kids loved the class so much I made sure
                                        to sign them up for robotics summer camp the organization was planning!&nbsp; Searching on ToC I even found a Tech Talk for
                                        Parents Meetup which helped answer tons of questions I had in supporting my
                                        kids interest and even more resources to pursue. ToC has definitely saved me
                                        time in trying to search for great programs that my kids will love”
